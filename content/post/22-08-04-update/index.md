[Lizzie Wilson](https://lwlsn.github.io/), [Iv√°n Paz](https://hangar.org/en/ivan-paz/) and myself Alex McLean organised a fun algorithmic pattern workshop as part of the [collect(_)](https://onthefly.space/read/on-the-fly-collect) festival, which was the final event of the Creative Europe on-the-fly project. It included a morning workshop on tablet weaving by [Dave Griffiths](https://thentrythis.org/about/dave/), who introduced this fascinating, ancient craft as a computational artform. This lead into to discussions about patterns in the contemporary practice of [live coding](https://toplap.org).

Around June 2022, we hosted six excellent speakers exploring algorithmic patterns from their own perspectives, in particular:
* Laura Devendorf on [weaving algorithmic patterns with AdaCAD]({{< relref "/events/laura-devendorf" >}})
* Bekah Smith on [the mathematics of juggling 'siteswap' patterns]({{< relref "/events/bekah-smith" >}})
* Ron Eglash on [heritage algorithms and generative justice]({{< relref "/events/ron-eglash" >}})
* Vernelle Noel on [algorithms of wire-bending]({{< relref "/events/vernelle-noel" >}})
* Sarah Hennigh Groff-Palermo on [live coding patterns]({{< relref "/events/sarah-ghp" >}})
* B C Manjunath on [Konnakol patterns in Carnatic music]({{< relref "/events/manjunath-b-c" >}})

The talks took place online, and happily are all archived and [available to watch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxqmZjMvoVzwJF2u82XfoAxZmbV_vt3nT) on our youtube channel.

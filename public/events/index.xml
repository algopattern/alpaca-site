However, “pattern” is often used as a pejorative term. Transdisciplinary scholar Andrew Hugill notes that for some composers, being accused of pattern-making implies that you have nothing original to say and fall back on mechanical formulae. With this workshop, we aim to rescue the term from its somewhat deprecatory usage in a number of arts disciplines, and disentangle algorithms from any false sense of unfathomable obscurity or complexity. This workshop focuses on how to characterise and define produced pattern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Participants will be invited to explore both the historical and contemporary use of algorithmic practices in pattern making. In a hands on session, we will be learning the practice of tablet weaving, where cards are twisted and flipped to make complex, three dimensional braiding patterns. We will approach this ancient practice from the perspective of live coders, using a web-based code interface to guide our real-world braids. Reflecting on this, the second part of the workshop will explore patterns in algorithmic music, and in audiovisual algorithmic art. Through this, we aim to gain deeper understanding of patterns in live coding practice, and discover ways in which we could take them further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workshop took place between connected hubs in Barcelona, Sheffield and Penryn, as part of &lt;a href="https://onthefly.space/read/on-the-fly-collect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on_the_fly_collect()&lt;/a> festival. You can read a &lt;a href="https://thentrythis.org/notes/2022/07/09/digital-is-physical-remote-tablet-weaving-explorations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog report on the tablet weaving&lt;/a> by workshop leader Dave Griffiths.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bekah Smith: The mathematics of juggling 'siteswap' patterns</title><link>https://algorithmicpattern.org/events/bekah-smith/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://algorithmicpattern.org/events/bekah-smith/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Among her multiple talents, &lt;a href="https://www.bekahjuggler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bekah Smith&lt;/a> is a professional juggler with 20 years experience, including touring and teaching around the world and co-founding her own circus. Passing juggling patterns is her speciality, using the siteswap juggling notation system to generate and experiment with new patterns from mathematical formalisms. In this hands-on talk, Bekah will introduce us to juggling siteswaps, and give insights into some of the mathematical, creative constraints that underlie them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siteswap notation&lt;/a> was created in the 1980’s and has been built upon by numerous jugglers since then. Bekah’s work with siteswap focuses on generating patterns for multiple jugglers passing objects together, especially ambidextrous rhythms and sequences where jugglers weave around each other. She also specializes in creating intricate patterns in which objects are not thrown, but placed on a surface, a technique which removes many of the limitations imposed upon juggling by gravity and untrained hand-eye-coordination. Depending on time and interest of participants, we will explore how to generate siteswap patterns and see visual examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk took place during June 2022, you can watch the archived stream in full above.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPHtgWk6UCtVU9je-GD9P1A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B C Manjunath&lt;/a> is a highly accomplished musician touring performances worldwide, including of the mridangam percussion instrument. On-line, he is perhaps best known as a strong proponent of Konnakol, the ancient Carnatic tradition of reciting intricate vocal rhythms, via his (often viral) videos demonstrating the topic. This online talk took the form of a live discussion with algorithmic musician and pattern researcher Alex McLean, exploring some of the mathematics of the pattern structures of Konnakol, and how the practice can expand our perception of time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At one time, simulations of crafts were rare, and practitioners could claim a kind of innocence. With the MetaVerse, AI, and other computational invasions of every aspect of life, a decolonial approach to craft grammars is desperately needed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Craft practices, knowledges, and communities are disappearing. These practices carry with them histories and cultures of people, knowledges, and social ties to communities. One of these practices is wire-bending in the Trinidad Carnival, which began in the 1930s. Some reasons for its disappearance include dying practitioners, lacking pedagogy, changing practices, and techno-centric developments. How might we employ algorithms, patterns, and mathematics in the restoration, remediation, and reconfiguration of this practice, knowledge, and community? In this talk, I share The Bailey-Derek Grammar, a mathematical description of this dying craft which has aided in documentation and transmission of this knowledge.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As the first speaker in the online Algorithmic Pattern Catalogue (alpaca) talk series, Laura Devendorf shared her web-based, free/open source AdaCAD system. Designed to be a drafting tool for weavers, AdaCAD could also be viewed as a visual programming language for making generative art within the extremely rich constraints of frame and jacquard looms. Its practical use extends not only to creating visual textile designs, but creating electronic circuits and sensors from the three-dimensional warp-and-weft structures of weave. In this talk, Laura introduced ADACad and some of the projects created with it, and took us through trying the software out for ourselves.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Laura Devendorf is an artist and researcher who questions relationships between technology and culture by playfully subverting and reinterpreting categorizations of “machine” and “body.” Her work presents alternative understandings of technology that draw heavily from feminist techno-science, trading notions of efficiency for engagement, control for humility, and individualism for cooperation and care. Her work takes the form of garments and tapestries with embedded electronics, open-source software, and mixed-media systems. Devendorf is an assistant professor in the ATLAS Institute and the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she directs the Unstable Design Lab, and holds a courtesy appointment in the Intermedia Arts Writing and Performance PhD Program. She received her PhD at the UC Berkeley School of Information.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

It included a morning workshop on tablet weaving by &lt;a href=&#34;https://thentrythis.org/about/dave/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dave Griffiths&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced this fascinating, ancient craft as a computational artform. This lead into to discussions about patterns in the contemporary practice of &lt;a href=&#34;https://toplap.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;live coding&lt;/a&gt;. Read Dave&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://thentrythis.org/notes/2022/07/09/digital-is-physical-remote-tablet-weaving-explorations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog post on his workshop&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Workshop: Patterns and Algorithmic Music</title>
      <link>https://algorithmicpattern.org/events/workshop-patterns-and-algorithmic-music/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2022 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic pattern can be described as the use of rules and well-defined instructions to produce and break symmetries, through combination and transformation operations. However, “pattern” is often used as a pejorative term. Transdisciplinary scholar Andrew Hugill notes that for some composers, being accused of pattern-making implies that you have nothing original to say and fall back on mechanical formulae. With this workshop, we aim to rescue the term from its somewhat deprecatory usage in a number of arts disciplines, and disentangle algorithms from any false sense of unfathomable obscurity or complexity. This workshop focuses on how to characterise and define produced pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants will be invited to explore both the historical and contemporary use of algorithmic practices in pattern making. In a hands on session, we will be learning the practice of tablet weaving, where cards are twisted and flipped to make complex, three dimensional braiding patterns. We will approach this ancient practice from the perspective of live coders, using a web-based code interface to guide our real-world braids. Reflecting on this, the second part of the workshop will explore patterns in algorithmic music, and in audiovisual algorithmic art. Through this, we aim to gain deeper understanding of patterns in live coding practice, and discover ways in which we could take them further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop took place between connected hubs in Barcelona, Sheffield and Penryn, as part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://onthefly.space/read/on-the-fly-collect&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on_the_fly_collect()&lt;/a&gt; festival. You can read a &lt;a href=&#34;https://thentrythis.org/notes/2022/07/09/digital-is-physical-remote-tablet-weaving-explorations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog report on the tablet weaving&lt;/a&gt; by workshop leader Dave Griffiths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among her multiple talents, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bekahjuggler.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bekah Smith&lt;/a&gt; is a professional juggler with 20 years experience, including touring and teaching around the world and co-founding her own circus. Passing juggling patterns is her speciality, using the siteswap juggling notation system to generate and experiment with new patterns from mathematical formalisms. In this hands-on talk, Bekah will introduce us to juggling siteswaps, and give insights into some of the mathematical, creative constraints that underlie them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Siteswap notation&lt;/a&gt; was created in the 1980’s and has been built upon by numerous jugglers since then. Bekah’s work with siteswap focuses on generating patterns for multiple jugglers passing objects together, especially ambidextrous rhythms and sequences where jugglers weave around each other. She also specializes in creating intricate patterns in which objects are not thrown, but placed on a surface, a technique which removes many of the limitations imposed upon juggling by gravity and untrained hand-eye-coordination. Depending on time and interest of participants, we will explore how to generate siteswap patterns and see visual examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk took place during June 2022, you can watch the archived stream in full above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time, simulations of crafts were rare, and practitioners could claim a kind of innocence. With the MetaVerse, AI, and other computational invasions of every aspect of life, a decolonial approach to craft grammars is desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craft practices, knowledges, and communities are disappearing. These practices carry with them histories and cultures of people, knowledges, and social ties to communities. One of these practices is wire-bending in the Trinidad Carnival, which began in the 1930s. Some reasons for its disappearance include dying practitioners, lacking pedagogy, changing practices, and techno-centric developments. How might we employ algorithms, patterns, and mathematics in the restoration, remediation, and reconfiguration of this practice, knowledge, and community? In this talk, I share The Bailey-Derek Grammar, a mathematical description of this dying craft which has aided in documentation and transmission of this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event took place at the end of May 2022. You can watch the recording above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first speaker in the online Algorithmic Pattern Catalogue (alpaca) talk series, Laura Devendorf shared her web-based, free/open source AdaCAD system. Designed to be a drafting tool for weavers, AdaCAD could also be viewed as a visual programming language for making generative art within the extremely rich constraints of frame and jacquard looms. Its practical use extends not only to creating visual textile designs, but creating electronic circuits and sensors from the three-dimensional warp-and-weft structures of weave. In this talk, Laura introduced ADACad and some of the projects created with it, and took us through trying the software out for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk took place during May 2022, you can watch the archive above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Devendorf is an artist and researcher who questions relationships between technology and culture by playfully subverting and reinterpreting categorizations of “machine” and “body.” Her work presents alternative understandings of technology that draw heavily from feminist techno-science, trading notions of efficiency for engagement, control for humility, and individualism for cooperation and care. Her work takes the form of garments and tapestries with embedded electronics, open-source software, and mixed-media systems. Devendorf is an assistant professor in the ATLAS Institute and the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she directs the Unstable Design Lab, and holds a courtesy appointment in the Intermedia Arts Writing and Performance PhD Program. She received her PhD at the UC Berkeley School of Information.&lt;/p&gt;

particular the newly released version 1.9. The session will be lead by
Alex McLean, the instigator of the TidalCycles project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to bring a laptop to get hands-on with TidalCycles. Please
try to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://tidalcycles.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TidalCycles&lt;/a&gt; in advance, but
help will be on hand if you have problems getting it going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll also take a quick look at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://strudel.tidalcycles.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Strudel&lt;/a&gt;, a port of TidalCycles for
the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

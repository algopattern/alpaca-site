summary: Online talk on patterns in the South Indian vocal tradition of Konnakol.
abstract: '[B C Manjunath](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPHtgWk6UCtVU9je-GD9P1A) is a highly accomplished musician touring performances worldwide, including of the mridangam percussion instrument. On-line, he is perhaps best known as a strong proponent of Konnakol, the ancient Carnatic tradition of reciting intricate vocal rhythms, via his (often viral) videos demonstrating the topic. This online talk took the form of a live discussion with algorithmic musician and pattern researcher Alex McLean, exploring some of the mathematics of the pattern structures of Konnakol, and how the practice can expand our perception of time.

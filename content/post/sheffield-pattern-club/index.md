Local live coders/pattern enthusiasts [Lucy
Cheesman](https://heavy-lifting.org/), [Ray
Morrison](https://soundcloud.com/eyemeasure) and I have started a monthly
'pattern club' in Sheffield, dedicated to a different kinds of hands-on pattern
making. The first two events were about live coding music, the last one in
December 2022 was about Kumihimo braiding, and the next one in January 2023 will
be about blackwork embroidery, lead by embroidery/creative tech expert [Toni
Buckby](https://tonibuckby.com/).

You can stay up to date by joining the mailing list via the website
[patternclub.org/sheffield](https://patternclub.org/sheffield/).

We're just getting started with this, but when things are a bit clearer we'll be
encouraging others to start local pattern clubs.
